## 🎯 Introduction
Categorizing customer service requests manually is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. To resolve this problem, this process needs to be automated. Generative AI provides efficient solution to make it automated.

## 💡 Inspiration
To make human life easy to process customer requests with cutting edge technologies like Generative AI.

## ⚙️ What It Does
It reads the requests in email docs, analyses the same and classifies the content into predefined request categories like type, subtype, etc.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We made use of cutting edge technologies like Generative AI, Native Mobile tech to achieve this goal.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Initially we tried with Open AI model but later came to know it has some limited quota which was exceeded. Hence, we switched to another model from Google (Gemini-1.5-Flash) which actually helped us to complete this challenge. We were flexible enough to switch between the two AI Model providers at run time of the hackathon event. 

## 🏃 How to Run
As this is a Native Android Mobile App, you need to run the project in Android Studio IDE which will build an APK file and the same can be installed on Android Mobile Device/Emulator.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- 🔹 Frontend: Native Android, Kotlin
- 🔹 Backend: Google AI Client SDK (Gemini) embedded in Frontend 
- 🔹 Database: NA
- 🔹 Other: Gemini-1.5-Flash AI Model
